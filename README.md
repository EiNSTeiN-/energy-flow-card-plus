## Goal

Although the code base is very different, the design of this card is heavily inspired the [Official Energy Distribution Card](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/energy/#energy-distribution).
The goal is to deliver a card that fits in the overall design of the Energy Dashboard, while providing more features, such as Individual Devices and bringing small UI enhancements.

## ⚠️ This documentation is still a WIP. Intructions for installation and usage will come soon.
